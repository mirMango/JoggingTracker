  <h1>About This Project</h1>
  <p>This project is a test application built using Ruby on Rails to track jogging times of users. Below are the requirements and features of the project:</p>

  <h2>Project Requirements</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>User must be able to create an account and log in.</li>
    <li>When logged in, a user can see, edit, and delete their entered times.</li>
    <li>Implement at least three roles with different permission levels:
      <ul>
        <li>A regular user can only CRUD their own records.</li>
        <li>A user manager can CRUD users.</li>
        <li>An admin can CRUD all records and users.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Each time entry must have a date, distance, and time.</li>
    <li>Each time entry should display the average speed when shown.</li>
    <li>Provide date filtering from-to.</li>
    <li>Generate a report on average speed and distance per week.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>REST API</h2>
  <p>Make it possible to perform all user actions via the API, including authentication. If using a mobile application and you don’t know how to create your own backend, you can use Firebase.com or similar services to create the API. You should be able to explain how a REST API works and demonstrate that by creating functional tests that use the REST Layer directly. Be prepared to use REST clients like Postman, cURL, etc., for this purpose.</p>

  <h2>Client-Side Actions</h2>
  <p>All actions need to be done client-side using AJAX. Refreshing the page is not acceptable.</p>

  <h2>Bonus Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Use React/React on Rails/React Rails for some of the complex components.</li>
    <li>Include unit and end-to-end tests.</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Design Requirements</h2>
  <p>Minimal UI/UX design is needed. The project will be evaluated as if you were delivering it to a client. The project must be fully functional and should not have any obvious missing pieces. The deadline for the project is 2 weeks from today.</p>

  <h2>Note</h2>
  <p>Please ensure the app is fully functional and doesn’t have any obvious missing pieces. The project will be evaluated as if you were delivering it to a client. The deadline for the project is 2 weeks from today.</p>
